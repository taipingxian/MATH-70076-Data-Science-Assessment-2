1 Project Description
The project begins by simulating a dataset of 100 points using a simple linear
model y=a+bx +error, where a=5, b=7, x values are randomly sampled from a
uniform distribution over the range [0, 50], and the error term follows a normal
distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 3. The generated data is then
used to fit a linear regression model, and the coefficients of this model are determined.
The analysis includes plotting the data along with the fitted regression
line, and also annotating the plot with the regression line’s equation.
Subsequently, the project introduces a more complex scenario by simulating data
from a quadratic model y=a+bx+cx 2+error, which introduces nonlinearity into
the dataset. Here, the coefficients a, b, and c are chosen to ensure the nonlinearity
is apparent in a scatterplot. Despite the underlying model being quadratic, a
linear model is fit to this data to explore the effects of model mis-specification. The
output and implications of fitting a linear model to nonlinear data are analyzed and
displayed graphically, highlighting the concept of ”best-fit” in terms of minimizing
the residual sum of squares.
Through these exercises, students learn to handle and analyze data in R, understand
the importance of model selection, and evaluate the fit of different statistical
models. This educational experience provides practical skills in data simulation,
regression analysis, and critical evaluation of model fits, crucial for aspiring data
scientists.
