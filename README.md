# Analytical Techniques in Data Science: Simulation and Regression Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on demonstrating simulation techniques and regression analysis within the field of data science. Using R, we simulate datasets under different model conditions and apply statistical analysis to evaluate the model fit. This educational exercise is crucial for understanding the importance of correct model specification and the implications of fitting models to data.

### Project Description

The project starts by simulating a simple linear dataset where:
- **Model Formula**: \( y = a + bx + error \)
- **Parameters**: a = 3, b = 4
- **Error Characteristics**: Normally distributed errors with mean 0 and SD 3

We then progress to more complex simulations involving quadratic models to introduce nonlinearity. The project explores the effects of fitting a linear model to this nonlinear data, illustrating key concepts in model fitting and evaluation.

## Repository Contents

- **Data Simulation Scripts**: Scripts to generate both linear and nonlinear datasets.
- **Analysis Scripts**: R scripts for fitting models and analyzing data.
- **Visualization Scripts**: Scripts to generate plots and visual representations of our analyses.
- **Project Report**: A detailed report of the project findings and methodologies.

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis or explore the datasets:

1. **Clone the repository**: 

2. **Navigate to the project directory** and open the R project file.

3. **Run the scripts** in the following order to generate data, fit models, and visualize the results:
- Data simulation
- Model fitting
- Data visualization

## Visualizations

Visuals are integral to understanding the data and the impacts of our analysis. They include scatter plots of the simulated data, regression lines, and annotations that clarify the modelâ€™s fit.
